Welcome to blockwallet!

This is an extremely simple cryptocurrency desktop wallet implementation, which uses electron and React.

Ideally, this will be used to connect to the simple cryptocurrency blockchain from the repo http://github.com/drummonda/BuildingBlocks (which will hopefully be deployed soon)

To get started, fork and clone the repository, and run:
```npm install```
followed by
```npm start``` to launch the app!
